# My Corne-ish Zen layout

## Philosophy

### Full row of numbers over numpad

This is a very personal choice.
I've never been particularly interested in the numpad, I feel I can type numbers just fine when they're in a row,
so I decided to just bring them down to homerow in my numbers layer, with their corresponding "shift-symbols" on
the top row.

It's not uncommon to have to use modifiers when typing numbers, so I also brought homerow mods to both hands in that
layer, just like in the base typing layer.

The bottom row is for the rest of the symbols I most commonly use,
particularly when writing numbers
(e.g. `.` and `,` for decimal and thousands separators,
and `[` and `]` for array indexing when programming).
I paid particular attention to putting `+` next to `-` since I use them with Ctrl as shortcuts to zoom in/out in
some applications.

### Seamless workflows when right hand is on the mouse

I've never been a fan of mouse keys,
so there are things for which I inevitably have to move my right hand from its keyboard half to a mouse.
The layout should make it easy to do things I need to do "in combination" with a mouse using just my left hand.
Thus, some things get priority on the left half of the keyboard in layers activated with the left thumbs.
For example:

- Shortcuts for:
  - Cut, Copy, Paste, Undo.
  - Close current window (`Alt+F4`).
  - Opeen Windows Explorer (`Win+E`).
  - Prev/next tabs when in the browser (`Ctrl+Shift+Tab` / `Ctrl+Tab`).
  - Prev/next virtual desktop (`Ctrl+Win+Left` / `Ctrl+Win+Right`).
  - Some application specific shortcuts that I use frequently.
    For example, getting a Github permalink to the currently selected block of code in Visual Studio Code
    (where I usually select code with the mouse, then activate the shortcut).
- All function keys.
  As a software developer, this is particluarly useful for debugging, where I might be flipping and/or scrolling
  through files using the mouse, or hovering over variables to look at their current values, while controlling how
  the debugger is stepping through the code just with my left hand.
  F5, F8, F10, F11, and F12, are particularly important here.
  F3 is also useful when searching.

### Leverage right half for things that assume I'm typing or have both hands on the keyboard

For example, shortcuts that then require me to type something, like opening PowerToys Run or
a tab-search in the browser.

### One-shot access to "system layer"

Most system functions are not a frequent part of my day to day usage of the keyboard,
so I don't feel like I need them to be easily accessible by just holding some key down.
When I have to use something in that layer
pretty much all the time I'm not in the middle of typing,
so it's not a hassle to hit (and release!) a quick key sequence to activate the layer,
then hit whatever key I need there.

Swapping bluetooth profiles, clearing the current bluetooth profile, swapping between preferred outputs (BT/USB),
resetting the keyboard half, and entering bootloader mode, are all things that fall into this category.
So is access to a very infrequently used QWERTY-based layer for gaming.
